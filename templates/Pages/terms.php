<h1 class="mb-3 text-center">Terms of Use</h1>
<br><br>
<h5 class="mb-3 text-center">This is a tiny, privately hosted web application.</h5>
<p>
   There is an upper limit to the number of people who can use this application at any one 
   time. There is an upper limit on how much editorial control or moderation I can provide. 
   There are just flat limits outside of my control, and this kind of system is not for high 
   traffic or high volume. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h5 class="mb-3 text-center">
    The ability for new people to register an account may be suspended at any time
</h5>
<p>
   This could happen for a variety of reasons that I can foresee, and some that I cannot. 
   This domain name has been in my possession for a long time, and I have no plans to sell 
   it or let it expire. I have no plans to shut down this application, but I reserve the 
   right to do it and with no notice or warning.
</p>
<br><br>
<h5 class="mb-3 text-center">
    The ability of existing users to log in may be suspended at any time
</h5>
<p>
   Again, this could happen for a variety of reasons that I can foresee, and some that I 
   cannot.

    The principle of Free Speech is repected to a degree, but it is one consideration of 
    many, here
</h5>
<p>
   It's actually worse than that, since you could be sanctioned for saying something that 
   someone else might have gotten away with saying. It's not fair, but it's the way it is. 
   All attempts at fairness will be tempered by human prejudice and politics, regardless 
   of how high-toned our self-rhetoric rises. Trust and friendship comes with perks.

<h5 class="mb-3 text-center">
    All rights are reserved, and all decisions are final
</h5>
<p>
   In the event that you are banned from this application, all of your content will be  
   overwritten with a generic message that the content is unavailable, and your email 
   and/or phone number will be removed from the database. I don't want any smoke, and 
   if you decide to leave on your own, you can ask me to remove your content and your 
   email and/or phone number from the database. I will do it, and I will do it promptly.
</p>

<h5 class="mb-3 text-center">
    One more cautionary note
</h5>
<p>
   Perhaps you've noticed that I am not a lawyer <em>and</em> that transparency is an 
   important value to me as it pertains to this website. So it is with transparency in 
   mind that I tell you that, although you are able to revise your messages after you 
   have written them, as many times as you'd like, the entire list of revisions will be 
   a click away from the current message, always and forever, unless or until you are 
   either banned or decide to leave. If you say something and regret it later, then you 
   will just have to live with what you said being a matter of public record.
